Currently

- __plain PyTorch__ - a lot of tedious work like writing [metrics]() or `for` loops
- __external frameworks__ - much less manual work and much less freedom
and flexibility (and [a lot of stuff]() hidden [under the hood]()).

[__torchtrain__]() tries to get what's best from both worlds while adding to the mix:
[short code](), [explicitness](), [functional approach](), [extensibility]() and [freedom]() to structure your code!

__All of that using single `>` pipe operator!__

## Tutorials

- [__Introduction__]() - quick tour around functionalities with CIFAR100 classification
and `tensorboard`.
- [__GAN training__]() - more advanced example and creating you own pipeline components.

## Contributing

This project is currently in it's infancy and help would be appreciated.
